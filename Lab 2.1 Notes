Things to find out:

1. Is Load A instantaneous/ requires execute? Parallel loading??
2. Should Load A and execute be allowed to be done together
3. Figure out shift register usage - datasheet
4. Possible unit testing of each chip before integration onto circuit
5. Layout on Fritzing before anythin physically
